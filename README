HOW TO RUN
----------
1. Run the make command to create "chain" executable.
2. There will presumably be an input file that the program can read from.
3. Type ./chain -h to view possible commands.
4. After running once, run clean command for best results.


COMMANDS
--------
./chain                                             (will take input.dat as default and print to output.dat by default)
./chain -h                                          (print help message)
./chain -i [inputfilename]                          (Takes inputfilename and prints to output.dat)
./chain -i [inputfilename] -o [outputfilename]      (Takes inputfilename and prints to outputfilename)


Version Control
---------------
The .git subdirectory can be found by running ls -la in the directory.

ISSUES
------
When running ./chain -i [randominputfilename] the output file will always be output.dat instead of [randominputfilename].out. 
That should be the only issue, and everything else should be functional.
